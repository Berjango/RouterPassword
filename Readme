Contains a Python program to automatically change the router password for the purpose of getting rid of hackers.

Please note, this is written for my router (Optus sagemcom) and a debian based live linux system but may still be useful to others if modified.

To install run the "install" script in a terminal.

This program fortunately only works locally to the router and controls firefox to log in and change the router password.

WARNING !! It is potentially dangerous to change your router password as if you are being targeted by hackers it will make them angry.They could disable your system and cause you to lose data.Do not run if 
you have valuable data connected to the internet or you have a system that cannot easily be restored.BE VERY CAREFUL!!!!!!!

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS :
First working version,very rough.
